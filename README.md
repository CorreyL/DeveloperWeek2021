# Do not download your PDF
## A story of digital document usability and security in your application

Users like to leave some of the requirements till the last minute and as such I put together a guide with samples that outlines several PDF libraries that could save you some time. 

### I need to support PDFs within my app, how do I do that?

- We could let people download or open a PDF in a new tab
- We could implement our own viewer
- We could leverage an existing viewer out there
